Welcome to the Mastermind Game repository! The Mastermind Game is a digital implementation of the classic board game "Mastermind," where a player tries to guess a color code within a limited number of attempts. In this project, you will find the source code and resources necessary to play the Mastermind Game in a virtual environment.

How to Play
Objective: The objective of the game is to decipher the randomly generated color code by the computer within a specific number of attempts.

Rules: The code consists of a sequence of colors (e.g., Red, Blue, Green, Yellow). You must guess the code within the available attempt limit. After each guess, the computer will provide feedback indicating how many colors are correct and in the correct position (black pegs) and how many correct colors are in the wrong position (white pegs).

Interface: The game interface can be text-based or graphical, depending on the implementation. Colors can be represented by numbers, letters, or symbols.

Running the Game: Start the game by executing the main program file. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your guesses. After each guess, feedback will be provided to help you refine your subsequent guesses.

Environment Setup
Prerequisites: Make sure you have the required programming language installed, along with any specific libraries or frameworks mentioned in the code.
